            In-depth interview with Silent Software founder Baron Reichart &#34;Kurt&#34; Von Wolfsheild about Return Fire&#39;s development and his philosophy on game design. Reveals Return Fire took about two years to develop and three months just for the visual &#34;look,&#34; with the 3DO handling 200,000-230,000 polygons per second. Credits team members Van Arno (graphic artist), Will Ware (programmer), and Alex Kasperavicius (producer). Von Wolfsheild describes the game as &#34;more a philosophy than a game&#34; designed for two-player competition, comparing it to chess. Discusses his background from MTV producer to game developer, his work on Firepower (the 16-bit prequel), and his &#34;Porsches in a VW world&#34; analogy for creating high-performance games. Expresses excitement about the upcoming M2 hardware.

Full credits listed: Director Baron Reichart Kurt Von Wolfshield, Audio/Associate Producer Alex Kasperavicius, Senior Programmer William Ware, Programmers Edgar Tolentino and James Host, Artist Van Arno, Layout David Pascal.</div>

            <div class="citation-abstract" style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">In-depth interview with Silent Software founder Baron Reichart &#34;Kurt&#34; Von Wolfsheild about Return Fire&#39;s development and his philosophy on game design. Reveals Return Fire took about two years to develop and three months just for the visual &#34;look,&#34; with the 3DO handling 200,000-230,000 polygons per second. Credits team members Van Arno (graphic artist), Will Ware (programmer), and Alex Kasperavicius (producer). Von Wolfsheild describes the game as &#34;more a philosophy than a game&#34; designed for two-player competition, comparing it to chess. Discusses his background from MTV producer to game developer, his work on Firepower (the 16-bit prequel), and his &#34;Porsches in a VW world&#34; analogy for creating high-performance games. Expresses excitement about the upcoming M2 hardware.</div>

            <div class="citation-abstract" style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">This 3DO Magazine (Japan) review presents Return Fire as a highly addictive, destruction-driven Capture the Flag action game that emphasizes tactical use of four distinct vehicles across large, cleverly designed maps. The article praises the game’s balance between simple objectives and deep strategy, highlighting its strong audiovisual direction, dynamic zoom, and especially its competitive two-player mode as central to the experience. Overall, Return Fire is portrayed as an outstanding original title whose focus on controlled chaos and replayability makes it one of the most compelling releases on the 3DO.</div>
