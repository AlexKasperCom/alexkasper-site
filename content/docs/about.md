Alex Kasper is a cybersecurity consultant, entrepreneur, and educator known as "the world's least famous hacker." A longtime partner and collaborator of Kevin Mitnick, Alex co-created the Certified Social Engineering Prevention Specialist (CSEPS) certification in the early 2000s—the world's first credential focused specifically on defending against social engineering attacks {{< ref "cseps-launch-2003" >}}.

## Background

Alex's career spans an unusually diverse range of industries:

### Cybersecurity & Social Engineering

Working alongside Kevin Mitnick beginning in the early days of the hacking scene, Alex developed deep expertise in social engineering—both offensive techniques and, more importantly, how to defend against them. This work culminated in the creation of CSEPS and ongoing training programs that help organizations recognize and resist manipulation.

Alex was featured in the documentary {{< cite "freedom-downtime-2001" >}}, which chronicled Mitnick's story and the broader hacking culture of the era.

### Video Games

In the mid-1990s, Alex produced **Return Fire** for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer at Silent Software {{< ref "return-fire-review-nextgen" >}}. The game became one of the system's most acclaimed titles and was later ported to multiple platforms.

### Film & Creative Industries

Alex's creative background includes film production work, including producing Martin Starr's first film, and various music publishing projects involving Berlin Philharmonic musicians.

## Current Work

Today Alex runs multiple businesses:

- **Naturesign** - A B2B SaaS platform generating regulatory documents for the flavor and fragrance industry
- **Kasper Defense** - Cybersecurity training focused on social engineering prevention, built around the PSPSP framework

Alex is also writing **Manufactured Urgency**, a book about recognizing and defending against social engineering attacks in the modern era.
